# HeartFailureAnalysis


Abstract

Background
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. Just in 2019, an estimated 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular diseases which accounts for 32% of all global deaths. Cardiovascular diseases are conditions affect the structure or the function of the heart. Heart failure is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases. It occurs when the heart doesn’t pump enough blood to the body resulting in the body to hold in salt and water, which in return causes swelling and shortness of breath. It is projected that the number of people diagnosed with heart failure will increase by 46% in 2030, which leaves 8 million patients with heart failure according to the American Heart Association. Since heart is one of the most vital organs, predicting heart failure and finding risk factors that may cause heart failure has become a priority for medical doctors and physicians.

Methods
In this paper, I analyzed a dataset of 299 patients with heart failure collected in 2015. I applied logistic regression to both predict the survival of patients and rank the features corresponding to the most important risk factors. Logistic regression is an extremely powerful algorithm, even for very complex problems, it does a spectacular job. Linear Regression is good not only for prediction; once you have a fitted Linear Regression model you can also learn things about relationships between the response and the predictive variables. All these characteristics of Logistic Regression makes it an indispensable tool for this research.

Results
My results demonstrated that serum creatinine, ejection fraction and age play a significant role in the survival of patients with heart failure. Using these 3 predictors alone can lead to more accurate predictions regarding the chances of patients’ survival.


Conclusions
The result of this analysis can have serious consequences in saving patients’ lives. It can help doctors create tools that may guide them to estimate the chance of survival rate for patients with heart failure and inspire scientists to investigate the effects of serum creatinine and ejection fraction on the survival from heart failure.
