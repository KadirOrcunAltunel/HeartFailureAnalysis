***Dataset***

I analyzed a dataset containing the medical records of 299 heart failure patients collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan), during April--December 2015. The patients consisted of 105 women and 194 men, and their ages range between 40 and 95 years old. All 299 patients had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and had previous heart failures that put them in classes III or IV of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of the stages of heart failure.

The dataset contains 13 features, which report clinical, body, and lifestyle information. Some features are binary: anemia, high blood pressure, diabetes, sex, and smoking.

**Creatine phosphokinase** (CPK) is an enzyme in the body. It is found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. When the total CPK level is very high, it most often means there has been injury or stress to muscle tissue, the heart, or the brain.

**Ejection fraction (EF)** refers to how well left ventricle (or right ventricle) pumps blood with each heartbeat. Most times, EF refers to the amount of blood being pumped out of the left ventricle each time it contracts. The left ventricle is the heart\'s main pumping chamber. EF is expressed as a percentage. An EF that is below normal can be a sign of heart failure. A normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) range from 55% to 70%. An LVEF of 65%, for example, means that 65% of the total amount of blood in the left ventricle is pumped out with each heartbeat.

**Platelets**, also called **thrombocytes**, are small blood cells that help blood to clot. When a blood vessel gets damaged, platelets gather at the damaged site and make a plug (clot). Clotting helps slow down and stop bleeding and helps wounds heal.

**Serum creatinine** test is a measure of how well kidneys are performing their job of filtering waste from blood.

**Creatinine** is a chemical compound left over from energy-producing processes in your muscles. Healthy kidneys filter creatinine out of the blood. Creatinine exits body as a waste product in urine. An increased level of creatinine may be a sign of poor kidney function.

**Serum Sodium** test measures the amount of sodium in blood. Sodium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help maintain fluid levels and the balance of chemicals in body called acids and bases. Sodium also helps nerves and muscles work properly. If serum sodium levels are too high or too low, it may mean that there might be a problem with kidneys, dehydration, or another medical condition.
