**Results and Conclusions**

Comparing our full model and reduced model, we can clearly see that using significant predictors alone can help doctors predict heart failure survival in patients.

The results from our full model and reduced model didn't differ as much except the fact we have seen an improved AIC on reduced model which made our prediction more accurate.

Full model:

Reduced model:

As we can see, our AIC went down by 10 points which is a great indication of a better fit for our model.


Moreover, looking at the importance of the predictors, we see that our reduced model has the predictors that has the importance to our prediction. We see that Age, Ejection Fraction, Serum Creatinine and Time are highly significant to the model which are all presented in our reduced model.

Consequently, we can deduce that doctors can determine the probability of death due to heart failure by just looking at ejection fraction and serum creatinine (based on bloodwork). These two blood indices are highly important in patients with heart failure. These indices can help doctors save time in their treatment without digging into other markers on blood work.

As a limitation of the study, I must report the small size of the dataset. Larger dataset would have permitted me to obtain more reliable results. Additional information about the physical features of the patients (height, weight, body mass index, etc.) and their occupational history would have been useful to detect additional risk factors for cardiovascular health diseases.
